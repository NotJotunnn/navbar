# Simple Navbar

This is another project that is part from freecodecamp's yt channel! link: https://youtu.be/3PHXvlpOkf4

No javascript was necessary for this test, althought I did give it my "spin".

## Practiced:
    1. Responsiveness
    2. Using scripted fonts from fontawesome
    3. Logo shadow by hand
